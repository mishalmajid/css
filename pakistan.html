        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Pakistan is a country located in <strong>South Asia</strong>. Before establishment of pakistan muslims used to live in india under rulership of Britishers. <strong>Quaid-e-Azam</strong> along with other leaders worked day and night for establishment of pakistan. For general elections Quaid-e-azam started a campaign and toured all over the india to convince people to vote for <strong>Muslim League</strong>. Besides this there were also many other acts which were not succcessful for example <strong>Jinnah-Gandhi Talk, Simla Conference</strong> e.t.c. After alot of efforts and struggle Quaid-e-azam succeed in establishing pakistan on <strong>14th August 1947</strong>. During migration many people(Muslims) were slaughtered. A british viceroy <strong>Sir Radcliff</strong> was appointed for division of cities and areas. He did an unfair division and gave major muslim areas to india for example <strong>Kashmir</strong>. Muslim army did their best and succeed in getting one third area of kashmir which is now called<strong> Azad Kashmir</strong>. When Muslims came in Pakistan there was no proper place for them to start work so they started work in open area. Soon as time pasess Muslims succeed in making pakistan a developed state. On<strong> 11 September 1948</strong> Quaid-e-azan died. And Liaqat Ali Khan become the prime minister. So this how Pakistan was created. </p>
